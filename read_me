These are owl/rdf ontologies modeling Bernard Bolzano's conceptual universe.
They were done as a part of Silvan Hungerbuehler's master thesis at the ILLC in Amsterdam.


full_uncontroversial: this is what I used in the thesis. a set of uncontroversial concepts 
from bolzano's mereology and theory of science.
inconsistent_thesis: this is the purposefully inconistent formalization of bolzano from the thesis.
inferred_test: these are the consequences derived from the full_uncontroversial statements.
slightly_flesh: is an extension of full_uncontroversial with more relations and concepts.
flawed_test_case: as far as i can remember this was an attempt to build a larger interpretation of 
bolzano than "inconsistent_thesis" which is also flawed in some ways.
